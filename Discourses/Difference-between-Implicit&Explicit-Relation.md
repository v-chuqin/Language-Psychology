# Difference between the Implicit and Explicit discourse relation

A conjunction sets up a relationship between two clauses. The most basic but least cohesive is the conjunction *and*. [Transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_words) are conjunctions that add cohesion to text and include *then*, *however*, *in fact*, and *consequently*. Conjunctions can also be implicit and deduced from correctly interpreting the text.

implicit discourse relation

 It often happens, especially with temporal and causal sequences, that the semantic relationship is clearly felt to be present but is unexpressed; â€¦

In written language conjunctions are used to signal the logical connections between ideas (Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978). More specifically, conjunctions are used to mark discourse structure and the function of various text segments (Geva, 1983).
